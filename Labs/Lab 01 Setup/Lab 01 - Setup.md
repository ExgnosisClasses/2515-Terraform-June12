# Lab 01 Setting up

## Part 1: Azure Cloudshell

- You can do this in your own Azure account, assuming you have permissions to create resource groups, blob storage and Virtual Machines.
- If not, you can use the provided VM

### Step 1: Getting into your Account
- you will be provided with an account that looks like the following, but will have a number instead of xx
- For the following screenshots, a dummy account `student98` is being used.
- **You will need access to a cell phone to authenticate your account**

```text
account: studentxx@markelephantscale.onmicrosoft.com
pass: Bingobob123
```

### Step 3: Log in

Go to [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com)

<img src="images/00screen11.png">

### Step 4: Open the cloud shell

- In the main Azure home page
- Select the `cloud shell` icon on the tool bar, next to the `copilot` idcone

<img src="images/99shell1.png">

- Select the `Bash` shell

<img src="images/99shell2.png">

- Select the Subscription from the drop-down list
- Select the No Storage option
- Your configuration should look like this

<img src="images/99shell3.png">

- You should see the shell display

```console
Requesting a Cloud Shell.Succeeded. 
Connecting terminal...

Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell

Type "az" to use Azure CLI
Type "help" to learn about Cloud Shell

Your Cloud Shell session will be ephemeral so no files or system changes will persist beyond your current session.
```

Once the console opens, you can find your id that you to use by executing `az account show`

```console
student98 [ ~ ]$ az account show
{
  "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
  "homeTenantId": "d84eef44-a147-4f60-8a78-01c2c07d347a",
  "id": "fb1c7e89-1238-4b64-9ee0-9df0ad9d0c81",
  "isDefault": true,
  "managedByTenants": [],
  "name": "Microsoft Azure Sponsorship",
  "state": "Enabled",
  "tenantId": "d84eef44-a147-4f60-8a78-01c2c07d347a",
  "user": {
    "cloudShellID": true,
    "name": "student98@markelephantscale.onmicrosoft.com",
    "type": "user"
  }
}
```

### You are ready to go!!

## Part 2: Creating the test environment

- Use any text editor you want on your local machine to create the text files specified in the lab.
- Use the file upload option in the file management drop down in the Azure cloud shell environment

<img src="images/20dropdown.png" width="913" alt="">

### Create the `providers.tf`

- Open the `providers.tf` file in your editor
- Replace the `subscription` placeholder with your own subscription
- Assume your subscription is 1a145f5-f00d-5289-c413-487764d2886b
- Then your file should look like this

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  subscription_id = "1a145f5-f00d-5289-c413-487764d2886b"
}

```

- Upload the file to the cloudshell and do an `ls` to ensure it is there.

--- 

## Part 2: Initialize Terraform

- Use the `terraform init` command to create the terraform environment.
- It should look something like this:

<img src="images/01init.png" width="762" alt=""> 


---

## Part 3: Create a test resource group

- Upload the `main.tf` file provided
- It looks like this

```terraform
# Lab 1 test

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "lab1" {
  name     = "Lab1"
  location = "eastus"
}
```

- All this file does is create a resource group.
- Run `terraform validate` to ensure the file parses correctly

<img src="images/02validate.png" width="370" alt="">

- Now run `terraform apply` and answer `yes` to the prompt
- You should see the following output:

<img src="images/03apply.png" width="1296" alt="">

- Confirm in the portal GUI that the resource group has been created by 

---

## Part 4: Destroy the resource group

- In the cloudshell, enter the command `terraform destroy` and answer yes to the prompt

<img src="images/04destroy.png" width="1248" alt="">

- You should see confirmation like this

<img src="images/destroyed.png" width="1248" alt="">

Check in the GUI to confirm that the resource group has been deleted.
