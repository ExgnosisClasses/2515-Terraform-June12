## About the Class

- This class is an introduction to the basic concepts of Terraform 
- We will not be creating complex deployments since the purpose of the class is to master the concepts and practices of Terraform.
- The Azure constructs we will be using Terraform for will be simplistic, so we can focus on Terraform and not Azure internals.

## Introductions

Please introduce yourself very briefly, we don't have a lot of time for this part. 

Main points to cover:

- Your experience with Terraform or any other infrastructure as code tools.
- Any specific objectives for the class or specific items you want to learn.
